# Data Manipulation and Publication-Grade Plots

> ðŸŽ¢ Data Manipulation and Publication-Grade Plots. A talk by Shangbo Wu on Feb 20th, 2023.

## Brief

This is a short 40-minute talk made towards my lab group (consisting mostly of students on path to graduation --- bachelor, master, and PhD all included), where we discuss:

* In what format should data be logged during experiments (CSV, long-form data)
* By what means should data be read and manipulated to prepare for plotting (with `pandas`)
* What library should be used for plotting publication-grade figures (I recommend `seaborn`)

Additionally, topics on *wide-form* and *long-form* data, data and attribute types, choosing color palettes based on data, extending `seaborn` with `matplotlib` where necessary, etc., are covered.

> **Note**: Unfortunately, the recordings of this talk will not be made publicly available.
